# assignment_file_ops_sprint
Steven Li

This assignment will require you to loosen up those file I/O and Regex muscles. You'll need to read in a dictionary file and create a simple parser that will search for words within it. This is a good chance to practice highly modular design and work with "micro classes" which can help you perform a variety of specific tasks.
